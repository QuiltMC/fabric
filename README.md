# Quilted Fabric API

Quilted Fabric API is a Quilt reimplementation of the [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) on top of the [Quilt Standard Libraries](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-standard-libraries).

The main objective is to aid both players and mod developers with the migration to the [Quilt toolchain](https://quiltmc.org) by allowing Fabric mods who depended on the Fabric API to work seamlessly and by letting Fabric API modules who doesn't yet have a QSL equivalent co-exist with other QSL modules.

While we try our best, **keep in mind that mod compatibility might not be 100%!** If you find any issues specific to Quilted Fabric API, please report them on our issue tracker. If you are a developer or player who needs support, check out our [community Discord server](https://discord.quiltmc.org)!
